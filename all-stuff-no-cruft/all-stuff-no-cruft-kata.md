# Kata: All Stuff, No Cruft (Conference Management System)
Reference: [nealford.com](https://nealford.com/katas/kata?id=AllStuffNoCruft) 

Conference organizer needs a management system for the conferences he runs for both speakers and attendees.

## Users
- hundreds of speakers
- dozens of event staff
- thousands of attendees

## Requirements
- attendees can access speaking schedule online, including room assignments
- speakers can manage talks (enter, edit, modify)
- attendees 'vote up/down' talks
- organizer can notify attendees of schedule changes up-to-the-minute (if attendees opt in)
- each conference (being a different subject) can be branded independently
- speaker slides are accessible online only to attendees
- evaluation system via web page, email, SMS, or phone

## Additional Context
- Conference runs across the US.
- Very small support staff.
- 'Bursty' traffic: extremely busy when conference is occurring.
- Conference organizer wants to easily 'skin' the site for different technology offerings.
